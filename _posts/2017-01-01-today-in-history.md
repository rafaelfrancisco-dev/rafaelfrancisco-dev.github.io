## ios

Completely redone in SwiftUI for the launch of iOS 14, layouts for both iPhone and iPad, support Widgets and Multi-Windows . Under 1.5 MB in size, having no external dependencies, it's even smaller than the android version.

## android

My first app, it shows the Wikipedia historical events split into categories (Events, Births, Deaths) and searchable by specific date. With the only external dependency being [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for image loading, it is extremely light and weighs under 4.5 MB, far surpassing similar apps on the Play Store, reached 50.000+ installs in the first year.
