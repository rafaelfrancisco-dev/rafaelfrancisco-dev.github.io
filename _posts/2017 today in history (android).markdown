## the start
My first app, it shows the Wikipedia historical events split into categories (Events, Births, Deaths) and searchable by specific date. With the only external dependency being [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for image loading, it is extremely light and weighs under 4.5 MB, far surpassing similar apps on the Play Store, reached 50.000+ installs in the first year.
