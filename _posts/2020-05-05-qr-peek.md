**QR Peek App Store description**
```
Ever wanted to project information stored in a QR code directly on the surface, like a real sheet of paper instead of just opening a link ? **Look no more !** 
QR Peek let's you create, share and project codes in Augmented Reality effortlessly.
```
I think it's pretty clear where I got the inspiration for this one, it uses ARKit to project a QR code's content (*stored as JSON in CloudKit*). Pretty simple app, I'ts just something I thought it would be somewhat useful in these troubled times.
